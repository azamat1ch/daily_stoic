## Recommended Approach for Quote Collection

1. Prioritize quotes from Project Gutenberg and other clearly public domain sources
2. Verify the translation rights - older translations (pre-1927) are safely in the public domain
3. Keep detailed records of the source of each quote including:
   - Original author (e.g., Seneca)
   - Source work (e.g., Letters to Lucilius, Letter 47)
   - Translator (if known)
   - Source of the text (e.g., Project Gutenberg URL)
4. Focus on the three main Stoic philosophers whose works are most widely available: Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca
